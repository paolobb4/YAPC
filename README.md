# YAPC
Welcome to **Y**et **A**nother **P**ong **C**lone (YAPC).

This is in fact my first complete game. Is not perfect in any sence of the word, but nonetheless complete and I'm proud of it.

I had a lot of fun making this small game and I hope its source code may be of help for anyone else.

This game was developed with Godot v3.0.5.

## Install
To play YAPC you may download the binary for your OS in the [realeses]() page or you may instead clone this repository and open the project with [Godot v3.0.5]() or greater.

Have fun :D
